## How does Kyverno work?

- Kyverno operates as an admission controller in Kubernetes.
- It intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server and evaluates policies.
- Kyverno can reject or modify requests that violate policy rules.
- It can also generate and apply policies to Kubernetes objects automatically.
